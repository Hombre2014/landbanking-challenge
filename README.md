# Landbanking Frontend Developer challenge

> Information to give to the candidate

## Overview

Your task is to implement a mostly complete mini-project. The goal is to see that you know how a project is put together and have the skills and experience to implement some basic functionality. The project description is open-ended, but you should not take more than 3 hours on implementation. In this time you will not be able to implement every feature you can think of, so you will have to leave functionality out. This is intentional, we do not want you to take a week writing a perfect project, we want to see what you can achieve in a limited time with an limited specification.
You may use google and any other development tools you normally use. You may not ask someone or something else to write any of the code for you. You may be asked specific answers about your code in a follow-up interview.

## Deliverables

1. The code in any form you prefer, eg zip, github link etc.
2. Actual time taken from start to finish
3. A brief description of your thought process during development, including limitations, known bugs, wishlist.
4. If your code executes, then an output of some sort, eg a test result. This will help where we couldn‚Äôt run your code to see that in your environment it did execute correctly.

## Technical information

The project should use the technologies listed below. If you do not know a particular technology, you may still proceed without it if you feel you could learn it quickly and that your other skills indicate strong abilities to compensate. In all cases, a brief justification as part of the project submission will be helpful.

- react
- tailwind css
- connection to an api, with data caching
- jest tests
- local storage

## Project specification

A customer is creating a website where people who would like to see wildlife (eg lions etc) can create a list of their favorite animals.
For each animal in the system, the user would be able to rate an animal and select which attributes of the animal they like or dislike.
To get a list of attributes for different animals, you could use a website like [Animal API - API-Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals).
You should not write a backend for storage, but you might choose to store data in the browser cache.
